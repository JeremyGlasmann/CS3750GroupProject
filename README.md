# CS3750GroupProject
This is a repository for my CS 3750 Software Engineering 2 Group Projects, it was created with Razor Pages .Net Framework with use of HTML, css, C#, and MySQL database to store the data for our application. I was involved in model creation and maintaining, page functionality and creation, file submission and downloadability, Unit Tests, and UI design. What I have in this repo is primarily the parts of the project I created or help work on.
